# Machine-Learning---Decision-Tree-Classifier
This repository gives a basic and easy way to understand ML Decision Tree Classifier
---

This repository is for those who wanted to start with MACHINE LEARNING. Here every step of training and testing a machine learning model is explained clearly. 

## Project Overview
- Worked on a small dataset (check the dataset attached in the repo)
- Trained a decision tree classifier to predict the outcomes based on the input features.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy metrics.

**SCENARIO**: An online music store where new users will sign up using age, gender, etc. and based on their profile various music albums are recommended that they likely to buy.  

**AIM**: To increase sales using Machine learning model

**IDEA**: Build a model and feed it with existing data so it learns patterns of various users. So when a user signs up we tell the model to 'we have a user with this profile. What is the kind of music they are interested in?'. 

Now our model will respond and give results. Based on this, we can suggest the music genre to users. 

## Machine Learning project workflow
1. Import the dataset
2. Clean the dataset
3. Split the data into  sets
  - Training set
  - Testing set
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Ask to make predictions
7. Evaluate (calculate accuracy) and improve

 ## Tech Stack Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
Clone project → install requirements → run notebook file.

## Folder structure
- Check the 'music.csv' dataset
- Run the 'ML_Proj_01.ipynb' file  ->  which will give the predictions
- Try the persistent model approach
- Check the code to get the decision tree visualisation

## Open to suggestions or improvements.
